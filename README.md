A Custom Widget is a third-party application that is configured in the JSON layout. You can place the custom widget on the custom page, custom tab (Auxiliary Information pane), or on the horizontal header of the Desktop.

To get started with building Custom Widgets, it may be a good idea to request a [developer sandbox]() from the Webex Contact Center Developer Portal.

Once the sandbox credentials have been emailed to you, open an incognito window from the browser and go to the Admin Portal. Authenticate here using the Administrator credentials provided when requesting a developer sandbox (NOTE: in my testing, the authentication process in the admin portal asks for an email twice. Once, before the password and Once after the password).
